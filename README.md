A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm primarily used for image recognition and processing. It consists of multiple layers that automatically learn features from input images through convolutional operations. CNNs are widely used in computer vision tasks such as object detection, classification, and segmentation.
